# --description--

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Let's start with the arithmetic operators, in particular with the **addition** `+` operator.
It is used to add two numbers, like:
```
>>> 5 + 3
8
```

# --instructions--

Calculate the sum between the numbers 4 and 9 (in this order), then print the variable `sum`

# --seed--

```c
int sum = [/][/][/];
printf("%d\n", sum);
```

# --answers--

- 4
- 9
-  + 
-  * 
- 13

# --solutions--

```c
int sum = 4 + 9;
printf("%d\n", sum);
```

# --output--

13
