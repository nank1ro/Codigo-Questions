# --description--

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Let's start with the arithmetic operators, in particular with the **addition** `+` operator.
It is used to add two numbers, like:
```python
>>> 5+3
8
```

# --instructions--

Calculate the sum between the numbers 4 and 9 (in this order), then print the variable `sum`

# --seed--

```python
sum = [/][/][/]
print(sum)
```

# --answers--

- 4
- 9
- +
- *
- 13

# --solutions--

```python
sum = 4+9
print(sum)
```

# --output--
