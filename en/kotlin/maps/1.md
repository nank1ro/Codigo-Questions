# --description--

**Maps** are similar to lists and sets, but you access values by looking up a *key* instead of an index.
A **Map** is a collection of _key-value_ pairs (or _entries_), where each key is unique, and it can be associated with one value.
The **Map** interface provides specific functions, such as access to value by key, searching keys and values, and so on.
__Maps__ can be created using the keyword `mapOf`:
```kotlin
val numbersMap = mapOf("key1" to 1, "key2" to 2, "key3" to 3)
```
This is a map called `numbersMap` with three *key-value pairs*.
The key `"key1"` points to the value `1`, `"key2"` to `2`, and so on.
