"__Hello, World!__" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.
We use the `println()` function to output data to the standard output device (screen).
To print `Hello, World!` on the screen with Kotlin we can write
```kotlin
println("Hello, World!")
```

---

`println()` moves the cursor to a new line after displaying its parameter, so subsequent output appears on the next line.
You can use `print()` instead, which leaves the cursor on the same line.
