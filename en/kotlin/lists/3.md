# --description--

You can access an individual item of the list by its index.
An index is like an address that identifies the item's place in the list.
The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this:
```kotlin
listName[index]
```

List indices begin with `0`, **not** `1`! You access the first item of an list like this: `listName[0]` or `listName.get(0)` or even `listName.first()`.
The second item in an list is at index __1__: `listName[1]`.

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to print the sum between the **second** and the **fourth** item of the list

# --seed--

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(5, 6, 7, 8)
println(numbers[/][/]numbers[/])
```
