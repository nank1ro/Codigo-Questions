# --description--

Kotlin has a basic Boolean type, called `Boolean`.
Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.
You can evaluate any expression in Kotlin, and get one of two answers, `true` or `false`.

# --instructions--

Assign to the variable `musicOn` the boolean value `true`

# --seed--

```kotlin
var musicOn [/][/]
```

# --answers--

- False
- True
- "true"
- = 
- true

# --solutions--

```kotlin
var musicOn = true
```
