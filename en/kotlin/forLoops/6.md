# --description--

You can iterate over a __String__.
```kotlin
for (char in 'abc') print(char + 1)
// prints bdc
```

In the example above we've printed each character + 1, so `'a'` becomes `'b'`, `'b'` becomes `'c'` and so on.

This is possibile because characters are stored as numbers corresponding to their [ASCII Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

So adding an integer to a character produces a new character corresponding to the new code value.

# --instructions--
