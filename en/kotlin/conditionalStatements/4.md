# --description--

Let's assume we have another condition to check, like in this example:
```kotlin
var num = 3
if (num == 2) {
	println("the number is 2")
} else if (num == 3) {
	println("the number is 3")
} else {
	println("do something else")
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 3`.
First of all, let's check if the number is equal to 2, this is false.
So let's move on to the second statement and check if `num` is equal to 3, being true we execute the following block of code by printing `the number is 3`

# --instructions--

Create an `else if` statement checking if `time` is equal to `12` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midday"`

# --seed--

```kotlin
var time = 12
if (time < 12) {
    println("It's morning")
} [/]([/][/][/])[/]
    println("[/]")
} else {
    println("It's afternoon")
}
```

# --answers--

- It's midday
- 12
- else if 
-  < 
-  == 
- :
- ;
- time
-  {

# --solutions--

```kotlin
var time = 12
if (time < 12) {
    println("It's morning")
} else if (time == 12) {
    println("It's midday")
} else {
    println("It's afternoon")
}
```

# --output--

It's midday
