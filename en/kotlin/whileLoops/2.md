# --description--

Let's analyze this snippet of code.
```kotlin
var counter = 0 // [1]
while (counter < 100) { // [2]
    counter += 10 // [3]
    println(counter)
}
```
- __[1]__: We initialize the `counter` variable to __0__.
- __[2]__: The conditional expression for the _while_ says: "repeat the statements in the body as long as counter is less than _100_".
- __[3]__: The `+=` operator adds _10_ to `counter` and assigns the result to `counter` in a single operation.

The ouput of the code above are the numbers ranging from _10_ to _100_ inclusive

# --instructions--

Fill in the blanks with the `while` loop to repeat the block of code in order to print the first five multiples of _5_.

# --seed--

```kotlin
var counter = 1
[/] (counter[/]5) {
    println(counter[/]5)
    counter[/]
}
```

# --answers--

# --solutions--

```kotlin
var counter = 1
while (counter <= 5) {
    println(counter * 5)
    counter++
}
```
