# --description--

Let's analyze this snippet of code.
```kotlin
var count = 0 // [1]
while (count < 100) { // [2]
    count += 10 // [3]
    println(count)
}
```
- __[1]__: We initialize the `count` variable to __0__.
- __[2]__: The conditional expression for the _while_ says: "repeat the statements in the body as long as count is less than _100_".
- __[3]__: The `+=` operator adds _10_ to `count` and assigns the result to `count` in a single operation.

The ouput of the code above are the numbers ranging from _10_ to _100_ inclusive

# --instructions--

Fill in the blanks with the `while` loop to repeat the block of code in order to print the first five multiples of _5_.

# --seed--

```kotlin
var count = 1
[/] (count[/]5) {
    println(count[/]5)
    count[/]
}
```

# --answers--

# --solutions--

```kotlin
var count = 1
while (count <= 5) {
    println(count * 5)
    count++
}
```
