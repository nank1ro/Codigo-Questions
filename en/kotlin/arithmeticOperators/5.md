# --description--

Let's see the **remainder** `%` operator.
It is used to find the remainder after a division between two numbers, like:
```kotlin
println(5 % 2) // 1
```
This evaluates to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```kotlin
println(9 % 3) // 0
```
This other evaluates to 0 because 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0

# --instructions--

Calculate the remainder between the numbers 10 and 4, then print the variable `remainder`

# --seed--

```kotlin
val remainder = [/][/][/]
println(remainder)
```

# --answers--

- 10
- 4
-  % 
-  * 
-  / 
- 2

# --solutions--

```kotlin
val remainder = 10 % 4
println(remainder)
```

# --output--

2
