Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Let's start with the arithmetic operators, in particular with the **addition** `+` operator.
It is used to add two numbers, like:
```kotlin
println(5 + 3) // 8
```

---

Let's continue with the **subtraction** `-` operator.
It is used to subtract one number from another, like:
```kotlin
println(5 - 3) // 2
```

---

Let's see the **multiplication** `*` operator.
It is used to multiply two numbers together, like:
```kotlin
println(5 * 3) // 15
```

---

Let's see the **division** `/` operator.
It is used to divide two numbers together, like:
```kotlin
println(10 / 5) // 2
```

---

Let's see the **remainder** `%` operator.
It is used to find the remainder after a division between two numbers, like:
```kotlin
println(5 % 2) // 1
```
This evaluates to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```kotlin
println(9 % 3) // 0
```
This other evaluates to 0 because 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0
