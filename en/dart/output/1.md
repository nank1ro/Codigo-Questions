# --description--

> Before I begin, I wanted to tell you that I am very happy to teach you Dart.
With this message I take the opportunity to let you know that the app you are using was written right in Dart, using the Flutter framework. So it is an honor for me to be able to share my expertise in the language.

"__Hello, World!__" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.
We use the `print()` function to output data to the standard output device (screen).
To print `Hello, World!` on the screen with Dart we can write
```dart
print("Hello, World!")
```

# --instructions--

Your program should print the string `Hello, Dart!` on the screen.

# --seed--

```dart
void main() {
    [/]([/], [/]);
}
```

# --answers--

- println
- print
- "Hello
- Dart!"
- Hello
- Dart!

# --solutions--

```dart
void main() {
    print("Hello, Dart!");
}
```

# --output--

Hello Dart!
