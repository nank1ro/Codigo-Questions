# --description--

Variables are containers for storing data values.
Every variable in Dart is an `Object`.
To create a variable, we need to give it a __name__ keeping in mind that it must not contain spaces.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
In Dart you declare constants with the `const` (short for _constant_) keyword and variables with the `var` (short for _variable_) keyword.
You can also use `final` to assign a value only once to a variable, when you don't know the value at _compile time_
The value of a `const`ant/`final` can't be changed once it's set, whereas a `var`iable can be set to a different value of the same type in the future.
An example of a variable creation named `x` is:
```dart
var x = 1;
```
In this way we have assigned the value `1` to the variable named `x`.
If we print the variable `x` we get back the number `1`:
```dart
print(x); // prints 1
```

# --instructions--

Assign to the variable `y` the value `2`.

# --before-asserts--

```dart
import 'package:dart_runner/main.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';

void main() {
  group('MainTest -', () {
```

# --asserts--

`y` must be equal to `2`.

```dart
  test('test1', () {
    expect(y, 2, reason: '--err-t1--');
  });
```

# --after-asserts--

```dart
  }, timeout: Timeout(const Duration(seconds: 1)));
}
```

# --solutions--

```dart
var y = 2;
```
