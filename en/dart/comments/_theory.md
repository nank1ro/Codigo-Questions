> Before I begin, I wanted to tell you that I am very happy to teach you Dart.
With this message I take the opportunity to let you know that the app you are using was written right in Dart, using the Flutter framework. So it is an honor for me to be able to share my expertise in the language.

Dart, like many other programming languages, allows you to document your code.
This allows you to write any text next to the code.
Comments are ignored by the compiler.

Dart supports _single-line_ comments, _multi-line_ comments, and _documentation_ comments.

Here is how to write a _single-line_ comment:
```dart
// This is a comment. It is not executed.
```
