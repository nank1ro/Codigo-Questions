JavaScript has a basic Boolean type, called `boolean`.
Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.
You can evaluate any expression in JavaScript, and get one of two answers, `true` or `false`.

We can store the boolean value `true` in a variable just like a number or a string.

The opposite value of `true` is `false`
