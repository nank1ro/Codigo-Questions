# --description--

Variables are containers for storing data values.
Every variable in JavaScript is an object.
To create a variable, we need to give it a **name** keeping in mind that it must not contain spaces.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
In JavaScript you declare constants with the `let` or `const` keywords and variables with the `var` keyword.
The value of a constant can't be changed once it's set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
An example of a variable creation named `x` is:
```javascript
var x = 1;
```
In this way we have assigned the value `1` to the variable named `x`.
If we print the variable `x` we get back the number `1`:
```javascript
console.log(x);
// prints 1
```

# --instructions--

Assign to the variable `y` the value `2`.

# --before-seed--

```javascript
// DO NOT EDIT FROM HERE
var _testFailedCount = 0;
var _testCount = 0;
var assert = require('assert')
const tryCatch = (...args) => {
	_testCount++
  try { assert(...args) }
  catch (e) {
    _testFailedCount++
    console.log(`Test Case '--err-t${_testCount}--' failed`);
  }
};
// DO NOT EDIT UNTIL HERE
```

# --asserts--

`y` must be equal to `2`.

```javascript
tryCatch(y == 2);
```

# --after-asserts--

```javascript
// DO NOT EDIT FROM HERE 
console.log(`Executed ${_testCount} tests, with ${_testFailedCount} failures`);
// DO NOT EDIT UNTIL HERE
```

# --solutions--

```javascript
let y = 2;
```
