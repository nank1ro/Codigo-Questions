In JavaScript we can use the `+` sign to display two or more strings together, like:
```javascript
console.log("Hello " + "JavaScript!") // prints "Hello JavaScript!"
```

---

Template literals allow us to display expressions like adding a string to a number, without using the `+` sign.
To create a valid template literal you have to use the backticks \`\` instead of double or single quotes.
You can insert variables inside the template literals using the dollar sign and curly braces `${expression}`

---

Every template literals statement consists of two parts, the `${}` where we insert the number or variable, and the normal string

---

Next, we add the different kind of value in curly braces so it'll display as one console.log statement. Like here, with `${5}`

---

Inserting variables like `friends` between the round brackets displays their value too

---

We can use `${}` to insert values as often as we like inside the template literals

---

Template literals are best used in print statements, but we can also store them in variables like normal strings.
