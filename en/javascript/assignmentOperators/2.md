# --description--

We already have an initialized variable `total`
```javascript
var total = 5;
```
Let's say that we want to add the number `2` to the variable `total`, we can write
```javascript
total = total + 2;
```
Okay, it works! But there is a shorter version to do the same thing:
```javascript
total += 2;
```
The sign `+=` is called **addition assignment**.
It adds a value to the variable value and assigns the result to that variable.

# --instructions--

Add to the variable `num` the value `15` using the *addition assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```javascript
var num = 75;
[/][/][/];
console.log(num);
```

# --answers--

- +
- +=
- =+
- num 
-  15

# --solutions--

```javascript
var num = 75;
num += 15;
console.log(num);
```

# --output--

90
