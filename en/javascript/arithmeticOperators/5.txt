Let's see the **remainder** `%` operator.
It is used to find the remainder after a division between two numbers, like:
```
console.log(5 % 2);
// prints 1
```
This evaluates to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```
console.log(9 % 3);
// prints 0
```
This other evaluates to 0 because 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0
