# --description--

Decision making is required when we want to execute code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
Let's assume we want to play outside only if the weather is nice.
In programming, we can save a boolean variable `niceWeather` and perform the action of playing outside `if` this variable is `true`, like:
```javascript
var niceWeather = true;
if (niceWeather) {
	// play outside
}
```

# --instructions--

Create an `if` statement checking if the `time` is lower than `12`, then in the code block print the string `"It's morning"`

# --seed--

```javascript
var time = 8;
[/] (time < 12) {
    console.log("It's morning");
}
```
