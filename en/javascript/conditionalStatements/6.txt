We can also nest a conditional statement (`if`, `else if` or `else`) inside another conditional statement, to create a more complex structure.
```
var num = 4;
if (num < 3) {
	console.log("the number is lower than 3");
} else {
	if (num == 3) {
		console.log("the number is 3");
	} else if (num == 4) {
		console.log("the number is 4");
	} else {
		console.log("the number is greather than 4");
	}
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.

Let's change the program of the day time, nesting a conditional statement inside the `else` statement.
The nested conditional statement should check if `time` is *lower* than `18` and in the block of code should print `"It's afternoon"`.
If the previous condition is `false`, print `"It's evening"`
