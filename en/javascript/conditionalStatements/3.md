# --description--

We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In JavaScript we can use the `else` statement, like:
```javascript
var niceWeather = true;
if (niceWeather) {
	// play outside
} else {
	// stay home
}
```

# --instructions--

Create an `else` statement and in the code block print the string `"It's afternoon"`

# --seed--

```javascript
var time = 15;
if (time < 12) {
    console.log("It's morning");
} [/][/]
    console.log("It's afternoon");
}
```

# --answers--

- It's afternoon
- 12
- else
-  < 
-  > 
- :
- ;
-  {

# --solutions--

```javascript
var time = 15;
if (time < 12) {
    console.log("It's morning");
} else {
    console.log("It's afternoon");
}
```

# --output--

It's afternoon
