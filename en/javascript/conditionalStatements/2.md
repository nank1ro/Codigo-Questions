# --description--

Let's continue with the previous example.
```javascript
var niceWeather = true;
if (niceWeather) {
    // play outside
}
```
We've seen that the `if` statement executes the block of code only if the condition is `true`.
Another important thing to consider is represented by the **curly brackets** `{}` which indicate a code block.

# --instructions--

Fix the `if` statement adding the *curly brackets* `{}`

# --seed--

```javascript
var time = 8;
if (time < 12) [/]
    console.log("It's morning");
[/]
```
