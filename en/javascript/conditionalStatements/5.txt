We can add as many `else if` statements as we want, there are no limits
```
var num = 4;
if (num == 2) {
	console.log("the number is 2");
} else if (num == 3) {
	console.log("the number is 3");
} else if (num == 4) {
	console.log("the number is 4");
} else if (num == 5) {
	console.log("the number is 5");
} else if (num == 6) {
	console.log("the number is 6");
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.
