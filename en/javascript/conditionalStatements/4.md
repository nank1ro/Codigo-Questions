# --description--

Let's assume we have another condition to check, like in this example:
```javascript
var num = 3;
if (num == 2) {
    console.log("the number is 2");
} else if (num == 3) {
    console.log("the number is 3");
} else {
    console.log("do something else");
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 3`.
First of all, let's check if the number is equal to 2, this is false.
So let's move on to the second statement and check if `num` is equal to 3, being true we execute the following block of code by printing `the number is 3`

# --instructions--

Create an `else if` statement checking if `time` is equal to `12` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midday"`

# --seed--

```javascript
var time = 12;
if (time < 12) {
    console.log("It's morning");
} [/]([/][/][/])[/]
    console.log("[/]");
} else {
    console.log("It's afternoon");
}
```

# --answers--

- It's midday
- 12
- else if 
-  < 
-  === 
- :
- ;
- time
-  {

# --solutions--

```javascript
var time = 12;
if (time < 12) {
    console.log("It's morning");
} else if (time === 12) {
    console.log("It's midday");
} else {
    console.log("It's afternoon");
}
```

# --output--

It's midday
