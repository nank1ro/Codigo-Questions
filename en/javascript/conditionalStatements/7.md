# --description--

The ternary conditional operator is a special operator with three parts, which takes the form `question ? answer1 : answer2`.
It's a shortcut for evaluating one of two expressions based on whether `question` is true or false.
If `question` is true, it evaluates `answer1` and returns its value; otherwise, it evaluates `answer2` and returns its value.
```javascript
let a = 10, b = 20, c = 0;
if (a < b) {
	c = a;
} else {
	c = b;
}
console.log(c);
// prints 10
```
The shortand code for the above code is:
```javascript
let a = 10, b = 20, c = 0;
c = a < b ? a : b;
console.log(c);
// prints 10
```
`c` is set equal to `a`, because the condition `a < b` was true

# --instructions--

Create a valid ternary operator printing `"It's morning"` if the `time` is lower than `12`, otherwise `"It's afternoon"`

# --seed--

```javascript
var time = 15;
console.log(time < 12[/]"It's morning"[/]"It's afternoon");
```
