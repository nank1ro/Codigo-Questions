You can access an individual item of the array by its index.
An index is like an address that identifies the item's place in the array.
The index appears directly after the array name, in between brackets, like this:
```
arrayName[index];
```
Array indices begin with `0`, **not** `1`! You access the first item of an array like this: `arrayName[0]`.
The second item in an array is at index 1: `arrayName[1]`.
