Arrays are a datatype you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable name.
An array stores multiple values of one or multiple types and uses **indexes** to distinguish these values.
You can assign items to an array with an expression of the form:
```
var arrayName = [item1, item2];
```
