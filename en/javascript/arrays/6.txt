Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of an array.
Consider the following code:
```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let slice = numbers.slice(1, 3);
console.log(slice);
// prints [2, 3]
```
First, we create an array called `numbers`.
Then, we take a subsection of the array and store it in the slice array.
We do this by defining the indices we want to include after the name of the array: `numbers.slice(1, 3)`.
Keep in mind that the right index is excluded

Create an array called `middle` containing only the two middle numbers from `numbers`
