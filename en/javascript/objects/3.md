# --description--

Like Arrays, Dictionaries are _mutable_.
This means they can be changed after they are created (if are not declared constant).
One advantage of this is that we can add new _key/value pairs_ to the dictionary after it is created like so:
```javascript
dictName[newKeyName] = newValue;
```

# --instructions--

Add one more _key-value pair_ to the `user` variable, with the name `"profession"` for the key and `"Developer"` as the value

# --seed--

```javascript
var user = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30};
[/][[/]] = [/];
console.log(`The profession is ${user["profession"]}`);
```

# --answers--

- user
- [
- ]
- "profession"
- "Developer"
- [3]

# --solutions--

```javascript
var user = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30};
user["profession"] = "Developer";
console.log(`The profession is ${user["profession"]}`);
```

# --output--

The profession is Developer
