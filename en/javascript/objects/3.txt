Like Arrays, Dictionaries are _mutable_.
This means they can be changed after they are created (if are not declared constant).
One advantage of this is that we can add new _key/value pairs_ to the dictionary after it is created like so:
```
dictName[newKeyName] = newValue;
```

Add one more _key-value pair_ to the `user` variable, with the name `"profession"` for the key and `"Developer"` as the value
