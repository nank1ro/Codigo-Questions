**Objects** are similar to arrays, but you access values by looking up a *key* instead of an index
A key can be any string or number.
Objects are enclosed in curly brackets, like so:
```
var objectName = {"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 3};
```
This is a dictionary called `objectName` with three *key-value pairs*.
The key `key1` points to the value `1`, `key2` to `2`, and so on.
