You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values.
Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.
In JavaScript we use the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function:
```
function sayHi() {
	console.log("Hello!");
}
sayHi();
// prints "Hello!"
```
