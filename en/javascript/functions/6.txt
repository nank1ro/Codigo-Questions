The __rest parameter__ syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
Write rest parameters by inserting three period characters `...` before the parameter's name.
The values passed to a rest parameter are made available within the function's body as an array.
For example, a rest parameter with a name of `numbers` is made available within the function's body as a constant array called numbers
