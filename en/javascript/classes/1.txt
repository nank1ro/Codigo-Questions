JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```
arrayName.push("value");
```
JavaScript checks to see if `arrayName` has a `push()` method (which all arrays have) and executes that method if it finds it.
