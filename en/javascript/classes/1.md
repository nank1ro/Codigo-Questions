# --description--

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```javascript
arrayName.push("value");
```
JavaScript checks to see if `arrayName` has a `push()` method (which all arrays have) and executes that method if it finds it.

# --instructions--

Call the `pop()` method to remove the last item from the list

# --seed--

```javascript
var animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog"];
[/].[/][/];
console.log(animals);
```

# --answers--

- pop
- ()
- animals
- []
- pop("frog")

# --solutions--

```javascript
var animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog"];
animals.pop();
console.log(animals);
```

# --output--

["dog", "cat"]
