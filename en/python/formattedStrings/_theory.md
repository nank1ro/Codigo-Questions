In Python we can use the `+` sign to display two or more strings together, like:
```python
>>> print("Hello " + "Python!")
Hello Python!
```

---

But using the sign `+` to add a number like '10' to a string like ` "friends"` produces an error as they are a different kind of values

---

Formatted strings allow us to display expressions like adding a string to a number, without any error.

---

Every formatted string statement consists of two parts, first the character `f`, then the string that we want to format

---

Next, we add the different kind of value in curly braces so it'll display as one print statement. Like here, with `{5}`

---

Inserting variables like `friends` between the curly braces displays their value too

---

We can use curly braces to insert values as often as we like inside the formatted string

---

Formatted strings are best used in print statements, as we can't store them in variables like normal strings.
