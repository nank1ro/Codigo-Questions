# --description--

Like Lists, Dictionaries are _mutable_.
This means they can be changed after they are created.
One advantage of this is that we can add new _key/value pairs_ to the dictionary after it is created like so:
```python
dict_name[new_key_name] = new_value
```

# --instructions--

Add one more _key-value pair_ to the `user` variable, with the name `"profession"` for the key and `"Developer"` as the value

# --seed--

```python
user = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30}
[/][/][/][/][/][/]
print(user["profession"])
```

# --answers--

- user
- [
- ]
- "profession"
- "Developer"
-  = 
- [3]

# --solutions--

```python
user = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30}
user["profession"] = "Developer"
print(user["profession"])
```

# --output--

Developer
