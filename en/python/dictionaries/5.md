# --description--

Because dictionaries are mutable, they can be changed in many ways. Items can be removed from a dictionary with the `del` command:
```python
del dict_name[key_name]
```
will remove the key `key_name` and its associated value from the dictionary.

# --instructions--

Delete the key `age` from the dictionary

# --seed--

```python
user = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30}
