A __module__ is a file that can contain any kind of Python code.
Modules allow us to use code again and again.

---

There are a lot of __built-in modules__ that can help us with all sorts of things, like working with dates and times.
In order to include a module we use the `import` keyword

---

We can also just import specific functions we need from a module using the `from` and `import` keywords

---

We can also rename a function by importing it with the `as` keyword
