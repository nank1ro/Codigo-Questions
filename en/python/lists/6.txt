Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list.
Consider the following code:
```
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> slice = numbers[1:3]
>>> print(slice)
[2, 3]
```
First, we create a list called `numbers`.
Then, we take a subsection of the list and store it in the slice list.
We do this by defining the indices we want to include after the name of the list: `numbers[1:3]`.
In Python, when we specify a portion of a list in this manner, we include the element with the first index, `1`, but we exclude the element with the second index, `3`.
