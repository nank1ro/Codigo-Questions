# --description--

You can slice a string exactly like a list! In fact, you can think of strings as lists of characters: each character is a sequential item in the list, starting from index `0`.
```python
list_name[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
list_name[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items
```
If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn't have to be included.

# --instructions--

- Assign to `first_name` a slice of `full_name` from index `0` up until *but not including* index `4`.
- Assign to `last_name` a slice of `full_name` from index `4` until the end of the string

# --seed--

```python
full_name = "Sam Smith"
first_name = [/][/]
last_name = [/][/]
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
```

# --answers--

- full_name
- [:4]
- [:3]
- full_name
- [4:]
- [4:2]

# --solutions--

```python
full_name = "Sam Smith"
first_name = full_name[:3]
last_name = full_name[4:]
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
```

# --output--

Sam
Smith
