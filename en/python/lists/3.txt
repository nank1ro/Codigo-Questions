A list index behaves like any other variable name! It can be used to access as well as assign values.
You saw how to access a list index like this:
```
names = ["Jeremiah", "Barney", "Ivan", "Noel"]
names[0] # Gets the value "Jeremiah"
```
This is how an assignment works:
```
names = ["Jeremiah", "Barney", "Ivan", "Noel"]
names[0] = "Jordan"
names[0] # Gets the new value "Jordan"
```
