# --description--

You can access an individual item of the list by its index.
An index is like an address that identifies the item's place in the list.
The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this:
```python
list_name[index]
```

List indices begin with `0`, **not** `1`! You access the first item in a list like this: `list_name[0]`.
The second item in a list is at index 1: `list_name[1]`.

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to print the sum between the **second** and the **fourth** item of the list

# --seed--

```python
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]
print(numbers[/][/]numbers[/])
```
