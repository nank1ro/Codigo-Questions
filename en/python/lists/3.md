# --description--

A list index behaves like any other variable name! It can be used to access as well as assign values.
You saw how to access a list index like this:
```python
names = ["Jeremiah", "Barney", "Ivan", "Noel"]
names[0] # Gets the value "Jeremiah"
```
This is how an assignment works:
```python
names = ["Jeremiah", "Barney", "Ivan", "Noel"]
names[0] = "Jordan"
names[0] # Gets the new value "Jordan"
```

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to replace the item that currently holds the value `"Mia"` with the name `"Sophie"`

# --seed--

```python
names = ["Charlotte", "Mia", "Jessica", "Hollie"]
[/][/] = "Sophie"
for name in names:
    print(name)
```
