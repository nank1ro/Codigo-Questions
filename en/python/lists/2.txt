You can access an individual item of the list by its index.
An index is like an address that identifies the item's place in the list.
The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this:
```
list_name[index]
```

List indices begin with `0`, **not** `1`! You access the first item in a list like this: `list_name[0]`.
The second item in a list is at index 1: `list_name[1]`.
