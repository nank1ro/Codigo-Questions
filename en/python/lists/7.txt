You can slice a string exactly like a list! In fact, you can think of strings as lists of characters: each character is a sequential item in the list, starting from index `0`.
```
list_name[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
list_name[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items
```
If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn't have to be included.

<section id="instructions">
- Assign to `first_name` a slice of `full_name` from index `0` up until *but not including* index `4`.
- Assign to `last_name` a slice of `full_name` from index `4` until the end of the string
