# --description--

You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values.
Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.
In Python we use the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function:
```python
def say_hi():
	print("Hello!")
```

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to create a valid function

# --seed--

```python
[/] say_hello(name):
print(f'Hello {[/]}!')

say_hello('Tobi')
```

# --answers--

- name
- "name"
- def
- func
- function

# --solutions--

```python
def say_hello(name):
print(f'Hello {name}!')

say_hello('Tobi')
```

# --output--

Hello Tobi!
