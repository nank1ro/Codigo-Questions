You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values.
Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.
In Python we use the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function:
```
def say_hi():
	print("Hello!")
```
