# --description--

We can also nest a conditional statement (`if`, `elif` or `else`) inside another conditional statement, to create a more complex structure.
```python
num = 4
if (num < 3):
	print("the number is lower than 3")
else:
	if (num == 3):
		print("the number is 3")
	elif (num == 4):
		print("the number is 4")
	else:
		print("the number is greather than 4")
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.

# --instructions--

Let's change the program of the day time, nesting a conditional statement inside the `else` statement.
The nested conditional statement should check if `time` is *lower* than `18` and in the block of code should print `"It's afternoon"`.
If the previous condition is `False`, print `"It's evening"`

# --seed--

```python
time = 19
if ((time > 0) and (time < 12)):
    print("It's morning")
elif (time == 12):
    print("It's midday")
elif (time == 0):
    print("It's midnight")
else:
    [/]([/][/][/]):
        print("It's afternoon")
    [/]
        print("It's evening")
```

# --answers--

- 18
- elif 
-  < 
-  == 
- :
- ;
- time
- else if:
- elseif:
- if 
- else:

# --solutions--

```python
time = 19
if ((time > 0) and (time < 12)):
    print("It's morning")
elif (time == 12):
    print("It's midday")
elif (time == 0):
    print("It's midnight")
else:
    if (time < 18):
        print("It's afternoon")
    else:
        print("It's evening")
```

# --output--

It's evening
