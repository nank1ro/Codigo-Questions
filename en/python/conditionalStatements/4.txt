Let's assume we have another condition to check, like in this example:
```
num = 3
if (num == 2):
	print("the number is 2")
elif (num == 3):
	print("the number is 3")
else:
	print("do something else")
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 3`.
First of all, let's check if the number is equal to 2, this is false.
So let's move on to the second statement and check if `num` is equal to 3, being true we execute the following block of code by printing `the number is 3`

Create an `elif` statement checking if `time` is equal to `12` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midday"`
