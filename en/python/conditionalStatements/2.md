# --description--

Let's continue with the previous example.
```python
nice_weather = True
if (nice_weather):
    # play outside
```
We've seen that the `if` statement executes the block of code only if the condition is `True`.
Another important thing to consider is represented by the **colons** `:` and the **indentation**, which indicate a code block start.
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is essential.
You can use your favorite number of spaces (2, 4, 6, 8), noting that the preferred is 4.
Here in the app, we suggest using the **TAB** key to indent your line of codes

# --instructions--

Fix the `if` statement adding the *colons* `:`

# --seed--

```python
time = 8
if (time < 12)[/]
    print("It's morning")
```

# --solutions--

```python
