We can add as many `elif` statements as we want, there are no limits
```
num = 4
if (num == 2):
	print("the number is 2")
elif (num == 3):
	print("the number is 3")
elif (num == 4):
	print("the number is 4")
elif (num == 5):
	print("the number is 5")
elif (num == 6):
	print("the number is 6")
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.
