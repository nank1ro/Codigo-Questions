# --description--

We can add as many `elif` statements as we want, there are no limits
```python
num = 4
if (num == 2):
	print("the number is 2")
elif (num == 3):
	print("the number is 3")
elif (num == 4):
	print("the number is 4")
elif (num == 5):
	print("the number is 5")
elif (num == 6):
	print("the number is 6")
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.

# --instructions--

Add a new `elif` statement checking if `time` is equal to `0` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midnight"`

# --seed--

```python
time = 0
if ((time > 0) and (time < 12)):
    print("It's morning")
elif (time == 12):
    print("It's midday")
[/]([/][/][/]):
    print("It's midnight")
else:
    print("It's afternoon")
```

# --answers--

- 0
- elif
-  < 
-  == 
- :
- ;
- time
- else if
- elseif
- else

# --solutions--

```python
time = 0
if ((time > 0) and (time < 12)):
    print("It's morning")
elif (time == 12):
    print("It's midday")

    print("It's midnight")
else:
    print("It's afternoon")
```
