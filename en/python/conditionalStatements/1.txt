Decision making is required when we want to execute code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
Let's assume we want to play outside only if the weather is nice.
In programming, we can save a boolean variable `nice_weather` and perform the action of playing outside `if` this variable is `True`, like:
```
nice_weather = True
if (nice_weather):
	# play outside
```

Create an `if` statement checking if the `time` is lower than `12`, then in the code block print the string `"It's morning"`
