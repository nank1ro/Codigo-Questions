# --description--

Decision making is required when we want to execute code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
Let's assume we want to play outside only if the weather is nice.
In programming, we can save a boolean variable `nice_weather` and perform the action of playing outside `if` this variable is `True`, like:
```python
nice_weather = True
if (nice_weather):
    # play outside
```

# --instructions--

Create an `if` statement checking if the `time` is lower than `12`, then in the code block print the string `"It's morning"`

# --seed--

```python
time = 8
[/] (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
```

# --answers--

- if
- ==
- =
- else
- ?

# --solutions--

```python
time = 8
if (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
```

# --output--

It's morning
