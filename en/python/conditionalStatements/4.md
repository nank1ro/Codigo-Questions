# --description--

Let's assume we have another condition to check, like in this example:
```python
num = 3
if (num == 2):
	print("the number is 2")
elif (num == 3):
	print("the number is 3")
else:
	print("do something else")
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 3`.
First of all, let's check if the number is equal to 2, this is false.
So let's move on to the second statement and check if `num` is equal to 3, being true we execute the following block of code by printing `the number is 3`

# --instructions--

Create an `elif` statement checking if `time` is equal to `12` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midday"`

# --seed--

```python
time = 12
if (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
[/]([/][/][/])[/]
    print("[/]")
else:
    print("It's afternoon")
```

# --answers--

- It's midday
- 12
- elif 
-  < 
-  == 
- :
- ;
- time

# --solutions--

```python
time = 12
if (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
elif (time == 12):
    print("It's midday")
else:
    print("It's afternoon")
```

# --output--

It's midday
