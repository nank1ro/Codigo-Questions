# --description--

We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In Python we can use the `else` statement, like:
```python
nice_weather = True
if (nice_weather):
	# play outside
else:
	# stay home
```

# --instructions--

Create an `else` statement and in the code block print the string `"It's afternoon"`

# --seed--

```python
time = 15
if (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
[/][/]
    print("It's afternoon")
```

# --answers--

- It's afternoon
- 12
- else
-  < 
-  > 
- :
- ;

# --solutions--

```python
time = 15
if (time < 12):
    print("It's morning")
else:
    print("It's afternoon")
```

# --output--

It's afternoon
