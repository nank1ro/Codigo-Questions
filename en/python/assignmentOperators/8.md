# --description--

Let's see the **floor assignment** `//=` operator.
It floor divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
So the followings are exactly the same
```python
num = num // 5
# is equal to
num //= 5
```

# --instructions--

Calculate the floor division of `result` with the value `3` using the *floor assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```python
result = 5
result [/][/]
print(result)
```

# --answers--

- /= 
- //= 
- / 
- =// 
- 3

# --solutions--

```python
result = 5
result //= 3
print(result)
```

# --output--
