# --description--

Let's see the **division assignment** `/=` operator.
It divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
So the followings are exactly the same
```python
num = num / 5
# is equal to
num /= 5
```

# --instructions--

Calculate the quotient of `result` diving its value by `5` using the *division assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```python
result = 50
result [/][/]
print(result)
```

# --answers--

- / 
- /= 
- =/ 
- 5
- 25

# --solutions--

```python
result = 50
result /= 5
print(result)
```

# --output--
