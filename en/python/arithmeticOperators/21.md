Update the `store` quantity.

# --seed--

```python
store = 60
sold = 50
bought = 55
# write after this line
```

# --before-asserts--

```python
import unittest

class CodigoTests(unittest.TestCase):
```

# --asserts--

The `store` quantity should be equal to 65

```python
    def test_1(self):
        self.assertEqual(store, 65, "--err-t1--")
```

# --after-asserts--

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
