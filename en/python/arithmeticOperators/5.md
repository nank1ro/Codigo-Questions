# --description--

Let's see the **modulus** `%` operator.
It is used to find the remainder after a division between two numbers, like:
```python
>>> 5 % 2
1
```
This evaluates to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```python
>>> 9 % 3
0
```
This other evaluates to 0 because 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0

# --instructions--

Calculate the modulus between the numbers 10 and 4, then print the variable `modulus`

# --seed--

```python
modulus = [/][/][/]
print(modulus)
```

# --answers--

- 10
- 4
- %
- *
- 2
- /

# --solutions--

```python
modulus = 10%4
print(modulus)
```

# --output--

2
