# --description--

The first argument `__init__()` is used to refer to the instance object, and by convention, that argument is called `self`.
If you add additional arguments (for instance, a `gender` and `legs` for your animal) setting each of those equal to `self.gender` and `self.legs` in the body of `__init__()` will make it so that when you create an instance object of your `Animal` class, you need to give each instance a gender and legs, and those will be associated with the particular instance you create

# --instructions--

Use `self.gender` and `self.legs` to assign those genders and legs to each object

# --seed--

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, gender, legs):
        [/].[/] = gender
        self.legs = [/]
```

# --answers--

- self
- gender
- =
- legs
- .
- ;

# --solutions--

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, gender, legs):
        self.gender = gender
        self.legs = legs
```
