The first argument `__init__()` is used to refer to the instance object, and by convention, that argument is called `self`.
If you add additional arguments (for instance, a `gender` and `legs` for your animal) setting each of those equal to `self.gender` and `self.legs` in the body of `__init__()` will make it so that when you create an instance object of your `Animal` class, you need to give each instance a gender and legs, and those will be associated with the particular instance you create
</section>
<section id="instructions">
Use `self.gender` and `self.legs` to assign those genders and legs to each object
