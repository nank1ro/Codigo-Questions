# --description--

Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```python
dict_name.items()
```
Python checks to see if `my_dict` has an `items()` method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.

# --instructions--

Call the `len` method to print out the length of the list

# --seed--

```python
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'frog']
print([/]([/]))
```

# --answers--

- len
- length
- animals
- "animals"

# --solutions--

```python
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'frog']
print(len(animals))
```

# --output--
