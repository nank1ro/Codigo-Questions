Let's replace `pass` with something else.
The method `__init__()` is required for classes, and it's used to __initialize__ the objects it creates.
`__init__()` always takes at least one argument, `self`, that refers to the object being created.
You can think of `__init__()` as the method that boots up each object the class creates.

<section id="instructions">
Define an `__init__()` method for your `Animal` class.
Pass it the argument `self` for now.
Finally, put the `pass` into the code block of the `__init__()` definition
