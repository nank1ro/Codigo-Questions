Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```
dict_name.items()
```
Python checks to see if `my_dict` has an `items()` method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.
