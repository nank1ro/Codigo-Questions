A basic class consists only of the `class` keyword and the name of the class, for example:
```
class ClassName:
	pass
```
</section>
<section id="instructions">
Create a class called `Animal`.
For now, in the code block of your class, use the `pass` keyword.
(`pass` doesn't do anything, but it's useful as a placeholder in areas of your code where Python expects an expression)
