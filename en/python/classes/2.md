# --description--

A basic class consists only of the `class` keyword and the name of the class, for example:
```python
class ClassName:
	pass
```

# --instructions--

Create a class called `Animal`.
For now, in the code block of your class, use the `pass` keyword.
(`pass` doesn't do anything, but it's useful as a placeholder in areas of your code where Python expects an expression)
