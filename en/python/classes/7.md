# --description--

When a class has its own functions, those functions are called __methods__. You've already seen one such method: `__init__()`.
But you can also define your own methods!

# --instructions--

Add a method, `description`, to your `Animal` class.
Using two separate `print` statements, it should print out the `gender` and `legs` of the animal it's called on.
Then call `description` method.

# --seed--

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, gender, legs):
        self.gender = gender
        self.legs = legs
    def [/]([/]):
        [/]([/][/][/])
        [/]([/][/][/])

dog = Animal("female", 5)
dog.description()
```

# --answers--
