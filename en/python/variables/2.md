# --description--

Variables are called in this way because the value they store can change.
We can update `x` by using `=` and giving it a new value.
```python
>>> x = 1
>>> print(x)
1
>>> x = 2
>>> print(x)
2
```

# --instructions--

Update the value of the variable `x` with the number `10`.

# --seed--

```python
x = 5
# write after this line
```

# --asserts--

`x` must be equal to `10`.

```python
assert x == 10, "--err-t1--"
```

# --solutions--

```python
x = 10
```
