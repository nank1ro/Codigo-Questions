# --description--

Variables are containers for storing data values.
Every variable in Python is an object and unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
To create a variable, we need to give it a **name** keeping in mind that it must not contain spaces.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
An example of a variable creation named `x` is:
```python
x = 1
```
In this way we have assigned the value `1` to the variable named `x`.
If we print the variable `x` we get back the number `1`:
```python
>>> print(x)
1
```

# --instructions--

Assign to the variable `y` the value `2`.
