# --description--

Just like in the addition assignment, we have the **decrement assignment** `-=`.
The functionality is the same, the only difference is that it performs the subtraction.
So the followings are exactly the same
```swift
var num = num - 5
// is equal to
num -= 5
```

# --instructions--

Subtract to the variable `result` the value `15` using the *decrement assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```swift
var result = 75
result [/][/]
print(result)
```

# --answers--

- - 
- -= 
- =- 
- 50
- 15

# --solutions--

```swift
var result = 75
result -= 15
print(result)
```

# --output--

60
