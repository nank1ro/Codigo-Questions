**Dictionaries** are similar to arrays and tuples, but you access values by looking up a *key* instead of an index
A key can be any string or number.
Dictionaries are enclosed in square brackets, like so:
```
var dictionaryName: [String: Int] = ["key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 3]
```
This is a dictionary called `dictionaryName` with three *key-value pairs*.
The key `key1` points to the value `1`, `key2` to `2`, and so on.
