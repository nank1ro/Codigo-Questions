# --description--

**Dictionaries** are similar to arrays and tuples, but you access values by looking up a *key* instead of an index
A key can be any string or number.
Dictionaries are enclosed in square brackets, like so:
```swift
var dictionaryName: [String: Int] = ["key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 3]
```
This is a dictionary called `dictionaryName` with three *key-value pairs*.
The key `key1` points to the value `1`, `key2` to `2`, and so on.

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to create a valid dictionary

# --seed--

```swift
var user: [String: [/]] = [/]"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30[/]
if let firstName = user[[/]] {
    print("The first name is \(firstName)")
}
```

# --answers--

- Any
- String
- Int
- [
- {
- }
- ]
- "first_name"
- first_name

# --solutions--

```swift
var user: [String: Any] = ["first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hood", "age": 30]
if let firstName = user["first_name"] {
    print("The first name is \(firstName)")
}
```

# --output--

The first name is John
