# --description--

Swift has a basic Boolean type, called `Bool`.
Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.
You can evaluate any expression in Swift, and get one of two answers, `true` or `false`.

Assign to the variable `musicOn` the boolean value `true`

# --seed--

```swift
musicOn [/][/]
```

# --answers--

- False
- True
- "true"
- = 
- true

# --solutions--

```swift
musicOn = true
```
