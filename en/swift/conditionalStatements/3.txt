We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In Swift we can use the `else` statement, like:
```
var niceWeather = true
if niceWeather {
	// play outside
} else {
	// stay home
}
```
