The ternary conditional operator is a special operator with three parts, which takes the form `question ? answer1 : answer2`.
It's a shortcut for evaluating one of two expressions based on whether `question` is true or false.
If `question` is true, it evaluates `answer1` and returns its value; otherwise, it evaluates `answer2` and returns its value.
```
let a = 10, b = 20, c: Int
if (a < b) {
	c = a
} else {
	c = b
}
print(c)
```
The shortand code for the above code is:
```
let a = 10, b = 20, c: Int
c = a < b ? a : b
print(c)
```
`c` is set equal to `a`, because the condition `a < b` was true
