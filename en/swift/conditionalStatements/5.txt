We can add as many `else if` statements as we want, there are no limits
```
var num = 4
if (num == 2) {
	print("the number is 2")
} else if num == 3 {
	print("the number is 3")
} else if (num == 4) {
	print("the number is 4")
} else if (num == 5) {
	print("the number is 5")
} else if (num == 6) {
	print("the number is 6")
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.
