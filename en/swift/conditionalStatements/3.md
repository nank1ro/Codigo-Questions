# --description--

We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In Swift we can use the `else` statement, like:
```swift
var niceWeather = true
if niceWeather {
    // play outside
} else {
    // stay home
}
```

# --instructions--

Create an `else` statement and in the code block print the string `"It's afternoon"`

# --seed--

```swift
var time = 15
if time < 12 {
    print("It's morning")
} [/][/]
    print("It's afternoon")
}
```

# --answers--

- It's afternoon
- 12
- else
-  < 
-  > 
- :
- ;
-  {

# --solutions--

```swift
var time = 15
if time < 12 {
    print("It's morning")
} else {
    print("It's afternoon")
}
```

# --output--

It's afternoon
