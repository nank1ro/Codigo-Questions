We can also nest a conditional statement (`if`, `else if` or `else`) inside another conditional statement, to create a more complex structure.
```
var num = 4
if num < 3 {
	print("the number is lower than 3")
} else {
	if num == 3 {
		print("the number is 3")
	} else if num == 4 {
		print("the number is 4")
	} else {
		print("the number is greather than 4")
	}
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 4`.

Let's change the program of the day time, nesting a conditional statement inside the `else` statement.
The nested conditional statement should check if `time` is *lower* than `18` and in the block of code should print `"It's afternoon"`.
If the previous condition is `false`, print `"It's evening"`
