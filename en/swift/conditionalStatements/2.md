# --description--

Let's continue with the previous example.
```swift
var niceWeather = true
if niceWeather {
	// play outside
}
```
We've seen that the `if` statement executes the block of code only if the condition is `true`.
Another important thing to consider is represented by the **curly brackets** `{}` which indicate a code block.

# --instructions--

Fix the `if` statement adding the *curly brackets* `{}`

# --seed--

```swift
var time = 8
if time < 12 [/]
    print("It's morning")
[/]
```

# --answers--

- if
- ==
- =
- else
- ?
- {
- }

# --solutions--

```swift
var time = 8
if time < 12 {
    print("It's morning")
}
```

# --output--

It's morning
