Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of an array.
Consider the following code:
```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let slice = numbers[1...2]
print(slice)
// prints [2, 3]
```
First, we create an array called `numbers`.
Then, we take a subsection of the array and store it in the slice array.
We do this by defining the indices we want to include after the name of the array: `numbers[1...2]`.
In Swift we can include the last index using `...`, but we can also exclude the last index using `..<`

Create an array called `middle` containing only the two middle numbers from `numbers`
