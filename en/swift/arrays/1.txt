Arrays are a datatype you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable name.
An array stores multiple values of one or multiple types and uses **indexes** to distinguish these values.
You can assign items to an array with an expression of the form:
```
var arrayName: [itemsType] = [item1, item2]
```
`itemsType` stands for the type of the items inside the array, for example, it can be `Int`, `String`, `Any`...
