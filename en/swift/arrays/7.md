# --description--

In Swift we can slice an array as we want!
```swift
// Grabs the first two items
listName[..<2]
// Grabs the fourth through last items
listName[3...]
```
If your array slice includes the very first or last item in an array, the index for that item doesn't have to be included

# --instructions--

Divide the `animals` exactly in half within the two groups

# --seed--

```swift
let animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog", "bear", "lion", "butterfly"]
let firstGroup = [/][[/][/]]
let secondGroup = [/][[/][/]]
print(firstGroup)
print(secondGroup)
```

# --answers--

- ...
- animals
- animals

# --solutions--

```swift
let animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog", "bear", "lion", "butterfly"]
let firstGroup = animals[..<3]
let secondGroup = animals[3...]
print(firstGroup)
print(secondGroup)
```

# --output--

["dog", "cat", "frog"]
["bear", "lion", "butterfly"]
