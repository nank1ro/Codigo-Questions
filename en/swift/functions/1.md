# --description--

You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values.
Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.
In Swift we use the `func` keyword followed by the name of the function:
```swift
func say_hi() {
	print("Hello!")
}
say_hi() // prints "Hello!"
```

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to create a valid function called `sayHello`

# --seed--

```swift
[/][/](name: String) {
    print("Hello \([/])!")
}
sayHello(name: "Tobi")
```

# --answers--

- name
- "name"
- func 
- function
- function
- sayHello

# --solutions--

```swift
func sayHello(name: String) {
    print("Hello \(name)!")
}
sayHello(name: "Tobi")
```

# --output--

Hello Tobi!
