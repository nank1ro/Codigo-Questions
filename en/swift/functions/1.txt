You might have considered the situation where you would like to reuse a piece of code, just with a few different values.
Instead of rewriting the whole code, it's much cleaner to define a function, which can then be used repeatedly.
In Swift we use the `func` keyword followed by the name of the function:
```
func say_hi() {
	print("Hello!")
}
say_hi() // prints "Hello!"
```
