Swift is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```
dictName.removeValue(forKey: "keyName")
```
Swift checks to see if `dictName` has a `removeValue()` method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.
