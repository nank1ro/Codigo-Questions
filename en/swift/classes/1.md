# --description--

Swift is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects.
You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods.
For example, when you call:
```swift
dictName.removeValue(forKey: "keyName")
```
Swift checks to see if `dictName` has a `removeValue()` method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.

# --instructions--

Call the `removeLast()` method to remove the last item from the list

# --seed--

```swift
var animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog"]
[/].[/][/]
print(animals)
```

# --answers--

- removeLast
- ()
- animals
- []
- removeLast("frog")

# --solutions--

```swift
var animals = ["dog", "cat", "frog"]
animals.removeLast()
print(animals)
```

# --output--

["dog", "cat"]
