# --description--

In Swift we also have the **repeat-while** variation of the `while` loop.
It performs a single pass through the loop block first, _before_ considering the loop's condition.
It then continues to repeat the loop until the condition is `false`.
The __repeat-while__ loop in Swift is analogous to a __do-while__ loop in other languages

# --instructions--
