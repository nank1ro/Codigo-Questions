Often in programming, we need to repeat a block of code, for example:
```
print("2 seconds")
print("3 seconds")
print("4 seconds")
print("5 seconds")
```
This produces the following output:
```
2 seconds
3 seconds
4 seconds
5 seconds
```
Obviously, for long statements we would spend a lot of time writing the code, but fortunately, we can use loops.
Let's learn the `while` loop, getting the same output above.
```
var count = 2
while count <= 5 {
    print("\(count) seconds")
    count += 1
}
```
So we created a variable `count` assigning `2`, the initial value.
Then we have used the `while` statement that will run the block of code until the condition `count <= 5` is `true`.
Inside the block of code, we should **NOT** miss to add the line `count += 1`.
It increments the `count` value, otherwise, our loop will be infinite
