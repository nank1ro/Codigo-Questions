In C we use the `printf` function with an expression in order to display two or more values together, like:
```c
>>> char c = 'C';
>>> printf("Hello %c!\n", c);
Hello C!
```
`%c` is used to display a single character

---

Formatted strings allow us to display expressions like adding a string to a number, without any error.
To display an integer we use the `%i` expression

---

Every formatted string statement consists of two parts, the text we want to include and the expression we want to format inside the text

---

Next, we add the different kind of value. Like here, with `%i`

---

Inserting variables like `friends` displays their value too

---

We can use expressions to insert values as often as we like inside the formatted string
