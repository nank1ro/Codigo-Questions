# --description--

Variables are containers for storing data values.
Every variable in C is an object and like other programming languages, C has commands for declaring a variable.
To create a variable, we need to give it a **type** and a **name** keeping in mind that it must not contain spaces.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
An example of a variable creation named `x` is:
```c
int x = 1;
```
In this way we have assigned the value `1` to the _integer_ variable named `x`.
If we print the variable `x` we get back the number `1`:
```c
>>> printf("%i\n", x);
1
```

# --instructions--

Assign to the variable `y` the value `2`.
