# --description--

Let's see the **division assignment** `/=` operator.
It divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
So the followings are exactly the same
```c
num = num / 5;
// is equal to
num /= 5;
```

# --instructions--

Calculate the quotient of `result` diving its value by `5` using the *division assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```c
int result = 50;
[/][/][/];
printf("%d\n", result);
```

# --answers--

-  / 
-  /= 
-  =/ 
- 5
- 25
- result

# --solutions--

```c
int result = 50;
result /= 5;
printf("%d\n", result);
```

# --output--

10
