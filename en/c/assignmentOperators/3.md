# --description--

Just like in the addition assignment, we have the **decrement assignment** `-=`.
The functionality is the same, the only difference is that it performs the subtraction.
So the followings are exactly the same
```c
num = num - 5;
// is equal to
num -= 5;
```

# --instructions--

Subtract to the variable `result` the value `15` using the *decrement assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```c
int result = 75;
result[/][/];
printf("%d\n", [/]);
```

# --answers--

-  - 
-  -= 
-  =- 
- 50
- 15
- result

# --solutions--

```c
int result = 75;
result -= 15;
printf("%d\n", result);
```

# --output--

60
