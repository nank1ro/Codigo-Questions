We already have an initialized variable `total`
```
int total = 5;
```
Let's say that we want to add the number `2` to the variable `total`, we can write
```
total = total + 2;
```
Okay, it works! But there is a shorter version to do the same thing:
```
total += 2;
```
The sign `+=` is called **addition assignment**.
It adds a value to the variable value and assigns the result to that variable.
