# --description--

We already have an initialized variable `total`
```c
int total = 5;
```
Let's say that we want to add the number `2` to the variable `total`, we can write
```c
total = total + 2;
```
Okay, it works! But there is a shorter version to do the same thing:
```c
total += 2;
```
The sign `+=` is called **addition assignment**.
It adds a value to the variable value and assigns the result to that variable.

# --instructions--

Add to the variable `num` the value `15` using the *addition assignment* operator, then print its value

# --seed--

```c
int num = 75;
[/][/][/];
printf("%d\n", num);
```

# --answers--

-  + 
-  += 
-  =+ 
- num
- 15

# --solutions--

```c
int num = 75;
num += 15;
printf("%d\n", num);
```

# --output--

90
