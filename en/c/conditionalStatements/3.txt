We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In C we can use the `else` statement, like:
```
bool nice_weather = false;
if (nice_weather) {
	// play outside
} else {
	// stay home
}
```
