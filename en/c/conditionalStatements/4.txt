Let's assume we have another condition to check, like in this example:
```
int num = 3;
if (num == 2) {
	printf("the number is 2\n");
} else if (num == 3) {
	printf("the number is 3\n");
} else {
	printf("do something else\n");
}
```
and the output of this code is `the number is 3`.
First of all, let's check if the number is equal to 2, this is false.
So let's move on to the second statement and check if `num` is equal to 3, being true we execute the following block of code by printing `the number is 3`

Create an `else if` statement checking if `time` is equal to `12` and, in the code block, print the string `"It's midday"`
