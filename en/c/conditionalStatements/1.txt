Decision making is required when we want to execute code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
Let's assume we want to play outside only if the weather is nice.
In programming, we can save a boolean variable `nice_weather` and perform the action of playing outside `if` this variable is `true`, like:
```
bool nice_weather = true;
if (nice_weather) {
	// play outside
}
```
