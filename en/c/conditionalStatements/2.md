# --description--

Let's continue with the previous example.
```c
bool nice_weather = true;
if (nice_weather) {
    // play outside
}
```
We've seen that the `if` statement executes the block of code only if the condition is `true`.
Another important thing to consider is represented by the **curly brackets** `{}` which indicate a code block.

# --instructions--

Fix the `if` statement adding the *curly brackets* `{}`

# --seed--

```c
int time = 8;
[/] (time[/]12) [/]
    printf("It's morning\n");
[/]
```

# --answers--

- if
-  == 
-  = 
- else
-  ? 
-  < 
- {
- }

# --solutions--

```c
int time = 8;
if (time < 12) {
    printf("It's morning\n");
}
```

# --output--

It's morning
