# --description--

Decision making is required when we want to execute code only if a certain condition is satisfied.
Let's assume we want to play outside only if the weather is nice.
In programming, we can save a boolean variable `nice_weather` and perform the action of playing outside `if` this variable is `true`, like:
```c
bool nice_weather = true;
if (nice_weather) {
    // play outside
}
```

# --instructions--

Create an `if` statement checking if the `time` is lower than `12`, then in the code block print the string `"It's morning"`

# --seed--

```c
int time = 8;
[/] (time[/]12) {
    printf("It's morning\n");
}
```

# --answers--

- if
-  == 
-  = 
-  ? 
-  < 
- else

# --solutions--

```c
int time = 8;
if (time < 12) {
    printf("It's morning\n");
}
```

# --output--

It's morning
