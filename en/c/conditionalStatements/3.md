# --description--

We just saw how to execute a block of code if a condition occurs, now let's see how to execute another block of code if the first condition fails.
We go to play outside if the weather is nice; otherwise, we stay home.
In C we can use the `else` statement, like:
```c
bool nice_weather = false;
if (nice_weather) {
    // play outside
} else {
    // stay home
}
```

# --instructions--

Create an `else` statement and in the code block print the string `"It's afternoon"`

# --seed--

```c
int time = 15;
if (time < 12) {
    printf("It's morning\n");
}[/]{
    printf("[/]\n");
}
```

# --answers--

- It's afternoon
- 12
-  else 
-  < 
-  > 
- :
- ;

# --solutions--

```c
int time = 15;
if (time < 12) {
    printf("It's morning\n");
} else {
    printf("It's afternoon\n");
}
```

# --output--

It's afternoon
