# --description--

"__Hello, World!__" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.
We use the `printf()` function to output data to the standard output device (screen).
Every C program uses libraries, which give the ability to execute necessary functions, for example the print on the screen function is defined in the `stdio.h` header file.
The first code which will run will always reside in the main function.
To print `Hello, World!` on the screen with C we can write
```c
printf("Hello, World!");
```
Finally we return `0` to indicate that our program was successful

# --instructions--

Your program should print the string `Hello, C!` on the screen.

# --seed--

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    [/]("[/][/]\n");
    return 0;
}
```

# --solutions--
