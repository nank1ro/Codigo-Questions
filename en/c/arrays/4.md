# --description--

You can calculate the length in bytes of an array obtaining the `sizeof` the array, then you need to divide it by the size of one element.
It works because every item in the array has the same type, and as such the same size.
The resulting *length* is the number of items it contains

# --instructions--

Complete the code in order to print the length of the array `numbers`

# --seed--

```c
int numbers[4] = {5, 6, 8, 4};

int length =[/]numbers /[/]numbers[/];

printf("%d\n", length);
```

# --answers--

- len
- str
- loop
- for
-  sizeof 
- [0]
-  sizeof 

# --solutions--

```c
int numbers[4] = {5, 6, 8, 4};

int length = sizeof numbers / sizeof numbers[0];

printf("%d\n", length);
```

# --output--

4
