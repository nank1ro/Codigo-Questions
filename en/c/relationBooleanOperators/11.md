# --instructions--

Check if `word` is **NOT** equal to `dog`, printing the boolean result.
Be aware that `strcmp` returns `0` only when the strings are **equal**, so don't be fooled into thinking that the 0 it returns is like the false boolean

# --seed--

```c
char word[] = "cat";
bool are_words_equal = strcmp(word, "cat")[/][/];
printf("%d\n", [/]);
```

# --answers--

- word
- "dog"
-  == 
-  = 
- dog
-  != 
- 0
- are_words_equal

# --solutions--

```c
char word[] = "cat";
bool are_words_equal = strcmp(word, "cat") == 0;
printf("%d\n", are_words_equal);
```

# --output--
