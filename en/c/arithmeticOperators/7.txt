Let's see the **floor division** using the `floor()` function.
This function returns the integral part of the quotient, for example:
```
>>> 5.0 / 2
2.5
>>> floor(2.5)
2.0
```
Also referred to as integer division. The resultant value is a whole integer, though the result's *type* is not necessarily int.
