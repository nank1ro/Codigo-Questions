# --description--

Let's see the **modulus** `%` operator.
It is used to find the remainder after a division between two numbers, like:
```
>>> 5 % 2
1
```
This evaluates to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```
>>> 9 % 3
0
```
This other evaluates to 0 because 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0

# --instructions--

Calculate the modulus between the numbers 10 and 4, then print the variable `modulus`

# --seed--

```c
int modulus = [/][/][/];
printf("%d\n", modulus);
```

# --answers--

- 10
- 4
-  % 
-  * 
- 2
-  / 

# --solutions--

```c
int modulus = 10 % 4;
printf("%d\n", modulus);
```

# --output--
